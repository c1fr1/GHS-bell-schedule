I do not have any personal objections to other schools referencing this code to make similar apps for nonprofit purposes, but it should be noted that apple discourages "copycat" apps as stated in the App Store Review Guidelines.


4.2.6
Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected unless they are submitted directly by the provider of the app's content. These services should not submit apps on behalf of their clients and should offer tools that let their clients create customized, innovative apps that provide unique customer experiences. Another acceptable option for template providers is to create a single binary to host all client content in an aggregated or "picker" model, for example as a restaurant finder app with separate customized entries or pages for each client restaurant, or as an event app with separate entries for each client event.

User facing features:
The first version of the app had no widget, and no notifications. This was rejected upon review because it did not have enough "user facing features". It was rejected a second time after I added notifications. It is possible that they didn't see the customizable notifications, but after making several improvements and adding the widget, it was accepted.

I wrote this after tweaking a few things, and fixing bugs after a month or two of not working on it. Looking back at my old code, it is pretty hard to read, so contact me on Github if you would like me to explain any functionalities.
